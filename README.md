# Flash Card Project

## Description:
A simple browser-based flash card program that I designed to help me review and study material for my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive program. The process of creating the site was a great way to review the material from unit 1 (HTML, CSS, JS) and the finished product will allow me to input and study new material as well!

## Getting Started: 

* [Link to Flash Cards](https://flashcards-ga.netlify.app)

* As of now, new cards need to be added through the back-end. This is done by creating a new varible with a class of flashCard and instances of question, answer, and language. Apply the method addCard() to add the card to the topic array.

## Next steps: 

* This is likely as far as this iteration of the app will go. I would like to create a new flash card app using Node Express and MongoDB, or Python/Django. These technologies would allow me to do the following: 
    * Card management: allow user to create new cards and remove cards they no longer want from the UI. A database will allow the card data to persist.
    * Add new topics: as the GA course continues, I would like to add new topics, each with their own series of cards.
