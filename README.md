# Flash Card Project

## Description:
A simple web-based flash card program designed to help me review and study material for my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive program. The process of creating the site was a great way to review the material from unit 1 (HTML, CSS, JS) and the finished product will allow me to input and study new material as well!
