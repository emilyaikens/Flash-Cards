# Flash Card Project

## Description:
A simple browser-based flash card program that I designed to help me review and study material for my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive program. The process of creating the site was a great way to review the material from unit 1 (HTML, CSS, JS) and the finished product will allow me to input and study new material as well!

## Technologies Used: 
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* GitHub Branching

## Getting Started: 

* [Link to Flash Cards](https://flashcards-ga.netlify.app)

* As of now, new cards need to be added through the back-end. Create a new varible with a class of flashCard and instances of question, answer, and language. Use the method addCard() to add the card to the topic array.

## Next steps: 

* Card management: allow user to create new cards and remove cards they no longer want
* Randomize function: "shuffle" the cards so that they show up in randomized order
* Add languages and topics: as the GA course continues, add new topics and their corresponding buttons, arrays etc.
* Recreate using node, once I know how
